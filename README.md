# React

functional programming is immutable (can’t be changed)

in react we’ll use `const` and not `let` so that the variables imply they’re not changeable 

Object-oriented programming is imperative - **Imperative programming** is when we tell our program exactly what we want to do and how we want it done. This means explicitly stating all the steps needed to get to an end result.

React is declarative - **Declarative programming** is when we tell our program what the end result should be and then let our program decide the best way to achieve this result.
